# Direst-digital-Synthesis
Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) is a method used to generate precise analog waveforms, primarily sine waves, from digital signals. It operates by utilizing a stable reference clock to drive a Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO), which produces a digital representation of the desired waveform based on a specified frequency.
